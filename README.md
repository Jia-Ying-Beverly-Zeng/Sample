# hello-world-node-pg

This repo contains a "Hello World" Node.js app that uses the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) driver to talk to a local CockroachDB cluster.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb.html).
